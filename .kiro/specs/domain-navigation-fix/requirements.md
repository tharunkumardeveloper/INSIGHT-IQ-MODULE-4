# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The application currently has issues with URL updates and page refreshing when users click menu items to change domains. When a user switches from one domain to another, the URL should properly update to reflect the new domain and the page content should refresh to show the correct data for the selected domain. Currently, the navigation doesn't work smoothly and users experience stale data or incorrect URLs.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the URL to immediately update when I select a new domain, so that I can see the correct domain path in the browser address bar.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a new domain from the domain modal THEN the URL SHALL update to `/domain/{newDomainKey}/dashboard`
2. WHEN the URL updates THEN the browser address bar SHALL reflect the new domain path immediately
3. WHEN a user bookmarks or shares the URL THEN it SHALL contain the correct domain identifier

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the page content to refresh completely when I switch domains, so that I see the correct data for the newly selected domain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user switches domains THEN all cached data for the previous domain SHALL be cleared
2. WHEN the new domain is selected THEN the page SHALL re-render with fresh data for the new domain
3. WHEN switching domains THEN loading states SHALL be shown while new data is being fetched
4. WHEN the domain switch is complete THEN all page components SHALL display data specific to the new domain

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want menu navigation to work correctly after switching domains, so that I can navigate between different pages within the new domain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on menu items after switching domains THEN the URL SHALL update to `/domain/{currentDomainKey}/{menuItem}`
2. WHEN navigating between menu items THEN the domain parameter SHALL remain consistent in the URL
3. WHEN a user refreshes the page on any menu item THEN the correct domain and page SHALL load based on the URL parameters

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the navigation to handle browser back/forward buttons correctly, so that I can use standard browser navigation after domain switches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uses the browser back button THEN the previous domain and page state SHALL be restored correctly
2. WHEN a user uses the browser forward button THEN the next domain and page state SHALL be restored correctly
3. WHEN navigating with browser buttons THEN the page content SHALL match the URL parameters
